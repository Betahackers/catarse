      introduction_html: Catarse is a space of exchange among individuals who together <br >enable the realization of creative projects.
      legend_html: We believe that connecting people that share value with respect to a cause; an idea; a project,  is one of the best ways to make them come true. <br><br> Be very welcome! This is your space as much as it is ours, after all, catharsis happens daily from the meeting of people in search of new ways to give life to more initiatives from society itself. We understand this to be an alternative to government resources, the sponsoring companies and bank loans = D

      explore_curious: Just looking around!
      explore_projects: I want to explore the projects.
      guide: Download here a complete guide with all the tips to elaborate your project in Catarse.
      introduction_html: We know you can't wait to have your project online, but first answer <br> (in a piece of paper) the following questions.
      legend_html: Having clear answers to these questions will help tremendously in structuring your project, <br>increasing the chances that it will be successful.
      send_project: I want to submit my project.
      submit: Next step!
      subtitle: Before submitting your project, it's good to think over a few important points.
      tip_eight: Create a GOOGLE DOCS spreadsheet and open your budget to show everyone how the money will be used. TRANSPARENCY is everything.
      tip_five: 'Remember that rewards are public promises. So, think very well when elaborating them, as well as the logistics in delivering them to your contributions. Our suggestion: think about immaterial rewards: downloads, experiences, courses e kisses.'
      tip_four: 'Don''t underestimate the work of a campaign. You will have to work hard during the entire period the project is live, so, it''s recommended that you don''t tire yourself too much in this process. Our recommendation: 40 days of campaign.'
      tip_one: People only engage when they realize the importance of a cause for society or for the person who leads a campaign. So be very clear about what is your inspiration and let it overflow into your project.
      tip_seven: You need to have a clear idea on how you will stir your network and convince it to contribute your project. Distribute your work weekly and change your approach with the network according to how close you are to it.
      tip_six: The video is the business card of your project. It's through it that the contributions will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended.
      tip_three: Calculate all costs for the project execution and rewards delivery. Also take into account your ability to engage people in order to define your financial goal.
      tip_two: Catarse is an excellent way to take the first steps. Therefore, define very well the purpose of your project, as well as who will benefit from it. Clearly defining your objectives is one of the best ways to engage people.
